            <h2>Summary:</h2>
            <p>
              Recent and emerging cryptographic proof techniques allow proofs of sufficiently complicated properties that it has become desirable to formally verify that the proofs indeed prove what they intend. This is an exciting new application area for verification. This workshop brings together practitioners from formal methods and cryptography, exploring opportunities and challenges at the intersection of formal methods and cryptographic proofs.

                <h2>Background:</h2>
                <p>
                    The recent rapid progress in cryptographic proofs has been driven largely by interest in distributed
                    ledger
                    technology (blockchains). See, for example, SNARKs [<a href="#6">6</a>], Bulletproofs [<a
                    href="#1">1</a>], STARKs [<a href="#5">5</a>], class group accumulators [<a href="#0">0</a>], and DARKs [<a href="#4">4</a>]. 
                    However, applications of these proof techniques range beyond this area to
                    encompass
                    assurance of proper functioning of components in complex machinery against Byzantine faults,
                    guaranteeing
                    authenticity and validity of distributed sensor readings, enabling decentralized communications,
                    protecting
                    sensitive data while allowing its analysis, and more. While the Boeing 777 and 787 flight control
                    systems,
                    the
                    SpaceX Dragon, and other recent advanced systems incorporate Byzantine fault tolerance into their
                    design,
                    today's newer cryptographic proof techniques enable far more sophistication and space/time
                    efficiency,
                    at
                    the
                    cost of greater software complexity. Formal methods can ensure that the additional complexity does
                    not
                    mean
                    reduced correctness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Zero knowledge (ZK) proofs comprise one cryptographic proof category of particular interest. A ZK
                    proof
                    allows
                    one party to confirm if another party is aware of a value X without revealing X or any other
                    information
                    besides
                    the other party's awareness of X. The complexity of modern ZK proofs make it hard to detect if the
                    proofs
                    are
                    constructed correctly and if the verification steps of ZK proofs are implemented correctly. An
                    invalid
                    implementation can accept invalid proofs; this can pose serious consequences depending on the
                    application.
                    Correct-by-construction and formally verified implementations are highly desirable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recent efforts have successfully brought formal methods to the broader field of cryptography. For
                    instance,
                    the
                    Everest project [<a href="#3">3</a>] implements a formally verified set of cryptographic primitives
                    like
                    ciphers, MACs,
                    elliptic
                    curve signatures, and hash functions exposed via a standard interface. The project may one day
                    provide a
                    drop-in
                    replacement for popular cryptographic toolkits. In the absence of such formal verification, simple
                    implementation bugs have led to severe vulnerabilities in popular cryptographic packages like
                    OpenSSL.
                    The
                    Heartbleed bug [<a href="#2">2</a>] for instance, was a buffer over-read, and a significant number
                    of
                    public facing
                    web-servers
                    were impacted. Efforts to verify memory access allow the full cryptographic stack to be verified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even if progress is being made towards verification of cryptographic primitives, higher-level
                    cryptographic
                    proof implementations remain unverified, despite trends accelerating broad adoption of these proofs
                    in
                    the
                    near
                    future. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners in relevant formal methods&mdash;including
                    dependent typing and more&mdash;and cryptographic proofs to establish greater interaction between the
                    fields,
                    identify
                    key opportunities of mutual interest, and accelerate the development and adoption of formal methods
                    for
                    cryptographic proofs. Emphasis is further placed on talks and papers that discuss broad
                    cross-cutting
                    themes
                    around cryptographic proofs for Byzantine fault tolerance, data validation, and authentication;
                    practical
                    dependently typed proofs; and other formal methods relevant potentially applicable to cryptographic
                    proofs.
