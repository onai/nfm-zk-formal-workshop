            <h2>High Level Description:</h2>
            <p>
                The aim of this workshop is to explore the intersection of (i) cryptographic proofs, and
                (ii) formal methods. The former is seeing increased adoption in a variety of settings like decentralized
                ledgers. In the absence of verified higher-level proofs of these algorithm implementations, all
                participants
                can face signficiant consequences. For those specializing in formal-verificant, this venue will provide
                an overview of proofs, applications, and opportunities. For those specializing in cryptography, this
                event will provide an opportunity to explore how formal methods can be used to harden and improve
                existing implementations.

            <h2>Workshop Statement:</h2>
            <p>
                Several cryptographic proof techniques such as SNARKs [<a href="#6">6</a>], Bulletproofs [<a
                    href="#1">1</a>], STARKs [<a href="#5">5</a>], class group
                accumulators [<a href="#0">0</a>], and DARKs [<a href="#4">4</a>] have emerged or greatly advanced over
                the past two
                years. They allow
                proofs
                of
                sufficiently complicated facts that it has become desirable to formally verify that the proofs indeed
                prove
                what
                they intend.
                This is an exciting new application area for verification and the goal of this workshop is to bring
                together
                practitioners from formal methods and cryptography, exploring opportunities and challenges at the
                intersection
                of formal methods and cryptographic proofs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The recent rapid progress in cryptographic proofs has been driven largely by interest in distributed
                ledger
                technology (blockchains). However, applications of these proof techniques range beyond this area to
                encompass
                assurance of proper functioning of components in complex machinery against Byzantine faults,
                guaranteeing
                authenticity and validity of distributed sensor readings, enabling decentralized communications,
                protecting
                sensitive data while allowing its analysis, and more. While the Boeing 777 and 787 flight control
                systems,
                the
                SpaceX Dragon, and other recent advanced systems incorporate Byzantine fault tolerance into their
                design,
                today's newer cryptographic proof techniques enable far more sophistication and space/time efficiency,
                at
                the
                cost of greater software complexity. Formal methods can ensure that the additional complexity does not
                mean
                reduced correctness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Zero knowledge (ZK) proofs comprise one cryptographic proof category of particular interest. A ZK proof
                allows
                one party to confirm if another party is aware of a value X without revealing X or any other information
                besides
                the other party's awareness of X. The complexity of modern ZK proofs make it hard to detect if the
                proofs
                are
                constructed correctly and if the verification steps of ZK proofs are implemented correctly. An invalid
                implementation can accept invalid proofs; this can pose serious consequences depending on the
                application.
                Correct-by-construction and formally verified implementations are highly desirable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recent efforts have successfully brought formal methods to the broader field of cryptography. For
                instance,
                the
                Everest project [<a href="#3">3</a>] implements a formally verified set of cryptographic primitives like
                ciphers, MACs,
                elliptic
                curve signatures, and hash functions exposed via a standard interface. The project may one day provide a
                drop-in
                replacement for popular cryptographic toolkits. In the absence of such formal verification, simple
                implementation bugs have led to severe vulnerabilities in popular cryptographic packages like OpenSSL.
                The
                Heartbleed bug [<a href="#2">2</a>] for instance, was a buffer over-read, and a significant number of
                public facing
                web-servers
                were impacted. Efforts to verify memory access allow the full cryptographic stack to be verified.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even if progress is being made towards verification of cryptographic primitives, higher-level
                cryptographic
                proof implementations remain unverified, despite trends accelerating broad adoption of these proofs in
                the
                near
                future. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners in relevant formal methods -
                including
                dependent typing and more - and cryptographic proofs to establish greater interaction between the
                fields,
                identify
                key opportunities of mutual interest, and accelerate the development and adoption of formal methods for
                cryptographic proofs. Emphasis is further placed on talks and papers that discuss broad cross-cutting
                themes
                around cryptographic proofs for Byzantine fault tolerance, data validation, and authentication;
                practical
                dependently typed proofs; and other formal methods relevant potentially applicable to cryptographic
                proofs.
