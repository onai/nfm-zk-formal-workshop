    <h2>High Level Description:</h2>
    <p>
        The aim of this workshop is to explore the intersection of (i) Zero-Knowledge cryptographic proofs, and
        (ii) formal methods. The former is seeing increased adoption in a variety of settings like decentralized
        ledgers. In the absence of verified higher-level proofs of these algorithm implementations, all participants
        can face signficiant consequences. For those specializing in formal-verificant, this venue will provide an
        overview of
        Zero-Knowledge proofs, applications, and opportunities. For those specializing in cryptography, this event
        will provide an opportunity to explore how formal methods can be used to harden and improve existing
        implementations.

    <h2>Workshop Statement:</h2>
    <p>
        Several cryptographic proof techniques such as SNARKs [6], Bulletproofs [1], STARKs [5], class group
        accumulators [0], and DARKs [4] have emerged or greatly advanced over the past two years. They allow proofs
        of
        sufficiently complicated facts that it has become desirable to formally verify that the proofs indeed prove
        what
        they intend.
        This is an exciting new application area for verification and the goal of this workshop is to bring together
        practitioners from formal methods and cryptography, exploring opportunities and challenges at the
        intersection
        of formal methods and cryptographic proofs.

        The recent rapid progress in cryptographic proofs has been driven largely by interest in distributed ledger
        technology (blockchains). However, applications of these proof techniques range beyond this area to
        encompass
        assurance of proper functioning of components in complex machinery against Byzantine faults, guaranteeing
        authenticity and validity of distributed sensor readings, enabling decentralized communications, protecting
        sensitive data while allowing its analysis, and more. While the Boeing 777 and 787 flight control systems,
        the
        SpaceX Dragon, and other recent advanced systems incorporate Byzantine fault tolerance into their design,
        today’s newer cryptographic proof techniques enable far more sophistication and space/time efficiency, at
        the
        cost of greater software complexity. Formal methods can ensure that the additional complexity does not mean
        reduced correctness.

        Zero knowledge (ZK) proofs comprise one cryptographic proof category of particular interest. A ZK proof
        allows
        one party to confirm if another party is aware of a value X without revealing X or any other information
        besides
        the other party's awareness of X. The complexity of modern ZK proofs make it hard to detect if the proofs
        are
        constructed correctly and if the verification steps of ZK proofs are implemented correctly. An invalid
        implementation can accept invalid proofs; this can pose serious consequences depending on the application.
        Correct-by-construction and formally verified implementations are highly desirable.

        Recent efforts have successfully brought formal methods to the broader field of cryptography. For instance,
        the
        Everest project [3] implements a formally verified set of cryptographic primitives like ciphers, MACs,
        elliptic
        curve signatures, and hash functions exposed via a standard interface. The project may one day provide a
        drop-in
        replacement for popular cryptographic toolkits. In the absence of such formal verification, simple
        implementation bugs have led to severe vulnerabilities in popular cryptographic packages like OpenSSL. The
        Heartbleed bug [2] for instance, was a buffer over-read, and a significant number of public facing
        web-servers
        were impacted. Efforts to verify memory access allow the full cryptographic stack to be verified.

        Even if progress is being made towards verification of cryptographic primitives, higher-level cryptographic
        proof implementations remain unverified, despite trends accelerating broad adoption of these proofs in the
        near
        future. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners in relevant formal methods including
        dependent typing and more—and cryptographic proofs to establish greater interaction between the fields,
        identify
        key opportunities of mutual interest, and accelerate the development and adoption of formal methods for
        cryptographic proofs. Emphasis is further placed on talks and papers that discuss broad cross-cutting themes
        around cryptographic proofs for Byzantine fault tolerance, data validation, and authentication; practical
        dependently typed proofs; and other formal methods relevant potentially applicable to cryptographic proofs.
